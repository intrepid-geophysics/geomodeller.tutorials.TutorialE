## Introduction

This tutorial is included as part of the GeoModeller v4.0 package, and is intended to be the fifth and final tutorial users should explore. This tutorial comes in eight parts, corresponding to T1-T8. In most sections, users are provided with a **completed** version of the project to verify against, or to start from if you wish to skip ahead.

### Tutorial T1

In this tutorial you will import the Bryah Basin GeoModeller project to use in later sections.

### Tutorial T2

In this tutorial you will specify the nature of the AEM survey completed and then import the recorded data from this survey.

You will learn to:

* Set a template for your survey from defaults, or edit your own
* Import the AEM data to your project for further processing

### Tutorial T3

In this tutorial you will either estimate the noise involved with the data of this survey or import it from a csv file.

You will learn to:

* Import or estimate noise in your recorded AEM data.

### Tutorial T4

In this tutorial you will use the EM Modelling wizard to find the apparent resistivity of your data at various depths.

You will learn to:

* Use the EM wizard to generate Apparent Resistivity data
* Visualise this data in your workspace.

### Tutorial T5

In this tutorial you will set up MPI (Message Passing Interface) which will provide increased resources for the EM solving process and increase speed.

You will learn how to:

* Run MPI with a number of processors to improve efficiency of your GeoModeller instance

### Tutorial T6

In this tutorial you will perform a 1D Time Domain inversion of ElectroMagnetic data, and then understand these results.

You will learn how to:

* Perform a 1D electro-magnetic Time domain inversion from the EM Wizard.
* How to visualise the cross-section obtained in your geological model

### Tutorial T7

In this tutorial you will perform a 2.5D Time Domain inversion of Electromagnetic data, and then understand these results.

You will learn how to:

* Perform a 2.5D electro-magnetic time domain inversion from the EM wizard
* How to visualise the results of this inversion

### Tutorial T8

In this tutorial you will open and study an inversion performed in the frequency domain and how it differs from time domain.
